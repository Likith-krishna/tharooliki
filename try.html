        Nov 15… this day holds a lot of emotions and happiness in my heart. Confessing to you on this day was totally unplanned. It was just a casual hangout with our classmates. When I saw you in the mall my heart dropped for a second The previous night I had wished that we would sit together in the theatre and we actually did. WE SAT TOGETHER ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.
        Just sitting next to you itself gave me so much happiness. I can’t even express it properly. The moment you started holding my hand, it was a complete butterfly moment. My heart started beating faster when you asked what was happening between us. I’m still not sure where I got the courage to say that I liked you. I was afraid of losing you—losing our bond.
        the moment you said you liked me back ❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭🫶🫶🫶🫶, even though I may not have shown any reaction, I was so happy. It was a completely new feeling for me. That was the day it officially became us.
        I confessed around 2 PM. I can still clearly see those moments. Only 30 minutes were left for the movie to end. I wished I could sit next to you, holding your hand like that, for a long time. Playing with you in Fun City was also one of the happiest moments of that day. Even though we played only 2–3 times together, I was almost next to you the entire time.
        cute reactions with your Pikachu will always stay in my heart. Those were my first-ever favourite pictures of yours. I lost count of how many times I looked at that picture. Full ah katti pudichite irundha un Pikachuu vaaaaa.
        In the end, it was time to leave. I really didn’t feel like sending you off. It got late, and you were so scared. Even I got upset seeing you in that condition. But when I heard that you reached home safely and that your father didn’t scold you, I was relieved and happy.

It’s officially us… after that, it was just pure caring for each other.
I came to college just because of you.
You grabbed my whole attention 🫶🫶🫶🫶
I was constantly looking at you in class, admiring you all the time.
I left feeling so happy and blessed to have such a caring person like you in my life.
I can’t forget the UPC week every day we used to talk in the evening and sit on Google Meet to study, but we always ended up talking and laughing together.
While writing the test, I was constantly looking at you, and the moment you looked back into my eyes… it was a feeling I can’t explain in words.
The first kiss you gave me in the hut I didn’t even expect it.
That whole day you looked so good, especially in that pink dress.
During the break, near tea time, when you held my hand and you were shivering — your reaction was so cute and sweet ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just kept looking at your face and your eyes…
